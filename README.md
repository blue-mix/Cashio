## 🧠 Product Philosophy

Cashio was built to address a common weakness in many expense trackers:

> They show numbers, but don’t help users *understand* their spending.

Core design principles:

* **Calendar-first exploration** instead of endless lists
* **Visual spending intensity** via heatmaps, not raw totals
* **Fast, low-friction data entry**
* **Local-first and privacy-respecting by default**

Every screen is designed to answer:

> *What did I spend, when, and why?*

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

Cashio follows **Clean Architecture + MVVM** with strict separation of concerns.

### Architectural Principles

* **Single source of truth** via immutable UI state
* **Unidirectional data flow**
* Business logic isolated in **UseCases**
* UI is fully **state-driven**

---

## ⚙️ Engineering Highlights

### State Management

* No UI-side sorting or filtering
* ViewModels own all transformation logic
* Predictable, testable state flows

### Calendar Heatmap (Advanced)

* **Dynamic percentile-based intensity**
* Automatically adapts to individual spending habits
* Avoids hardcoded thresholds that break across users

### Performance

* Pre-sorted day groups computed once
* Lazy rendering only where data size demands it
* Zero recomposition loops from derived UI logic

### UX Engineering

* Motion used to communicate hierarchy, not decoration
* Haptics reinforce intent
* Animations never block user input

---

## 🚀 Status

Feature-complete core flows; polishing analytics and performance; preparing for Play Store
compliance.

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

* ViewModel logic is isolated and testable
* UI driven by deterministic state
* Defensive error handling for all data flows

(Unit & UI tests planned as a next milestone.)
